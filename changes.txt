- Fixed crash on loading a game when pondering is enabled. Game now loads "paused", and resumes either when user clicks play, or makes a move.

- Fixed a bug where the user is unable to move pieces, if they click the board during the opponent's turn.

- A new busy-cursor is displayed if the mouse is moved over the board whilst the computer is thinking.

- The text "Thinking..." has been removed from the status bar once the computer has finishes thinking.

- Fixed the installer and project so that it works correctly with "DotNet Framework 4 (Client Profile)".

- Fixed an issue where SharpChess would crash after the first move, when trying to create the backup save game on a computer where the user doesn't have Administrator rights.
